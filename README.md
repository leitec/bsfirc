# bsfirc

This was my attempt at a minimal IRC client from about 2005. Code quality
is not very good in many places. It's inspired by its now-deceased brother
bsflite, an AIM client.

I haven't used it in a several years, and owing to lack of support
in its library irclib, some more modern things are missing. SSL and SASL
authentication come to mind, but surely there are others.

Use at your own risk, but please contribute if you wish.
